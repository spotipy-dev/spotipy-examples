# Streamlit example

This is a simple example of using Spotipy with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) with multi-user support.

The session only lasts until the tab is closed or is being refreshed.

## Prerequisites

- Install requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Fill out the `config.toml` file with the help of the [dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)

## Run the app

```console
streamlit run app.py
```

Streamlit should now open your browser. If not, visit [localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).
